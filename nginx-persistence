## Assumes some user has elevated nginx perms (for writing files as root),

sudo nginx -c /tmp/testing.conf 

## For added insurance against detection, launch using nginx via timeout:

Add "daemon off;" to config and then:
timeout 5m sudo nginx -c /tmp/testing.conf # automatic nginx shutdown after 5 minutes to avoid detection
